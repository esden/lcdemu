WHAT IS lcdemu
--------------

Lcdemu is a Mat*ix O*bital character display emulator. It was created to
allow people to see how the orginal is looking like when it works. The further
goal is to make it behave like the original but with the addition of lots of
debugging options. And the last reason to create lcdemu was that people that 
only have a laptop but like gadgets like lcdproc can use them.
