WHAT IS lcdemu
--------------

Lcdemu is a Mat*ix O*bital character display emulator. It was created to
allow people to see how the orginal is looking like when it works. The further
goal is to make it behave like the original but with the addition of lots of
debugging options. And the last reason to create lcdemu was that people that 
only have a laptop but like gadgets like lcdproc can use them.

COMPILING AND INSTALLING
------------------------

See INSTALL for general information.

Here a small help:

# ./configure
# make
# su -c "mkfifo /dev/lcd; chmod 666 /dev/lcd; make install"


RUNNING
-------

After the install (see the section above) you only have to start lcdemu 

# lcdemu

after that you can start a client. For example lcdproc that uses /dev/lcd to
communicate with the display.

# LCDd

Easy ha ?
